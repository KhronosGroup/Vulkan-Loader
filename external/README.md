# External dependencies

This directory provides a location where external projects can be cloned that are used by the loader.

In order to build tests the Google Test library must be present. It can be
checked out with:

```
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
```

If you don't have a local install of the Vulkan Headers they can be placed in
the externals folder with:

```
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers.git
```
